# Hello and welcome! ![Joystick](./images/joystick.png)

With 10+ [mobile games](#featured-projects), a [multiplayer VR simulator](#featured-projects) for PC, 5 [playable demonstrations](#demonstration-projects) and a lot of [code snippets (tips)](https://github.com/alissin/little-big-tips){:target="_blank"} on GitHub, I'm a _**Gameplay Programmer**_ with experience in developing gameplay mechanics for entertainment and educational game-focused applications. I also have a mobile development background with 10+ applications and 15+ years of software development experience.

Below you can **download** some of the [Featured Projects](#featured-projects) and **play online** the [Demonstrations](#demonstration-projects).

As an **extension** of this Portfolio, take a look at my [GitHub](https://github.com/alissin/little-big-tips){:target="_blank"} **repository**. You'll see the implementations of the main mechanics that were used in these [Demonstrations](#demonstration-projects) and some [VFX](#vfx-demonstrations) (Shader and Particle) examples.

By the way, if you are a programmer / developer, I really appreciate if these [code snippets](https://github.com/alissin/little-big-tips){:target="_blank"} could help you!
